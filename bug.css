The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you have an error in your calculation, such as a missing operator or parenthesis, it can lead to unexpected results or the CSS rule being ignored.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10px);` (missing closing parenthesis) or `width: calc(100% 10px);` (missing operator) would not.
